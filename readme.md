## How to use

* Clone the repo to your local.
* Open the Extension management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
* Enable Developer mode by clicking the toggle switch next to `Developer mode` at the top right corner.
* Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the extension directory.

Now you should see our `Buildkite watcher` in the extension list.

Next you just open up a page for your being built commit. Leave the tab open and instead of waiting for the build you can carry on your work at hand. You will get notified once the build is done. Clicking on the notification will lead you to the very tab which initialised the build.
